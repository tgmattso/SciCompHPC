# Code for Learning Parallel Programming

In this directory, we provide supporting code and helpful information for hands-on work in parallel programming.
* FLOP: this is a collection of simple programs and exercises for exploring the features of floating point arithmetic.
* learningC.c: this file is a C program the text of which explains the simple subset of C we use in these materials.
* MPI: exercises and supporting code to support learning MPI (the message passing interface)
* OpenMP\_CPU: exercises and supporting code to support learning how to use OpenMP to write multithreaded code for execution on a CPU.
* OpenMP\_GPU: exercises and supporting code to support learning GPU programming using OpenMP.
* SSH\_info: Instructions on how to use ssh with the cloud infrastructure at the University of Padua.
